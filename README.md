# Cloud 12 🌌

Welcome to **Cloud 12**, a project where I'm learning Go and developing a unique playlist engine. This engine allows users to create their own playlists by leveraging APIs from Apple Music and Pinterest.

## About The Project 🚀

Cloud 12 is more than just a coding journey; it's an exploration into the power of music and visual inspirations. By combining Apple Music's extensive music library and Pinterest's rich visual content, I aim to create an experience where users can curate playlists not just based on songs, but also the moods and themes captured in images.
